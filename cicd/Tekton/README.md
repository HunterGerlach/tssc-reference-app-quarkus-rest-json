# Tekton Pipeline

Note: Before running this pipeline make sure the Tekton TSSC ClusterTasks are installed in the cluster. This must be done as a cluster-admin privileged user:

```
git clone git@github.com:rhtconsulting/tssc-reference-pipelines.git
oc create -f tssc-reference-pipelines/tekton/tasks
```
